# Live Object Detection with YOLO (Jupyter Notebook)

This Jupyter Notebook (`object_detection.ipynb`) performs live object detection using a pre-trained YOLOv8 model and OpenCV. It captures video from your webcam, detects objects, and displays the results.


## Usage

1.  **Open `object_detection.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.**
2.  **Run the cells sequentially.**  The notebook will:
    *   Install `ultralytics` (if not already installed).
    *   Download the `yolov8n.pt` model weights (if needed) into a `weights` subdirectory.
    *   Start capturing video from your webcam.
    *   Display the live video with object detections.
3.  **Press 'q' to quit.**
